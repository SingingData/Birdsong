# Birdsong

The ten second recordings found in the audio folder contain birdsong captured with a motion capture video camera recordings of bird feeders in the Sierra Nevada foothills.  Audio was seperated and downsampled to 22000.  This dataset complements the paper 'Using Self-Supervised Learning of Birdsong for Downstream Industrial Audio Classification' presented at ICML 2020 Workshop on Self-supervision in Audio and Speech on July 17, 2020. https://openreview.net/forum?id=_P9LyJ5pMDb

Within the 'raw-audio-unfiltered-22000-sample' folder are the individual audio recording data arrays sampled at 22000.  As github limits directories to 1000 files, the training set is split into two directories.
