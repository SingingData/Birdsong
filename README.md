The ten second recordings found in the audio folder are data arrays with sample rate of 22000.

The recordings were captured with a motion capture video camera in the Sierra Nevada foothills.  Audio was seperated and downsampled to 22000.
This dataset complements the paper 'Using Self-Supervised Learning of Birdsong for Downstream Industrial Audio Classification' presented at ICML 2020 Workshop on Self-supervision in Audio and Speech on July 17, 2020.
